#R is a powerful language and environment for statistical
computing and graphics. It is a public domain
(a so called “GNU”) project which is similar
to the commercial S language and environment
which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly
AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John
Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as
a different implementation of S, and is much used
in as an educational language and research tool.
